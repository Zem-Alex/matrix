# matrix

## Calculator program for matrices.

### Requirements:

* Matrices are read from files

  * An example of a matrix in a file:
  
  ```
  1 2 3
  4 5 6
  7 8 9
  ```
  * File i1.txt - input file of the first matri, i2.txt - second:

* The size of the matrix in the file is determined automatically by the program, it is not specified by the user and is not recorded in the matrix file itself

- Supported operations:
  - addition of two matrices
  - subtraction of one matrix from another
  - multiplication of two matrices
  - matrix transposition
  - finding the determinant of the matrix (it is recommended not to exceed the size of the matrix 10x10)


* Example of using the program:

  i1.txt:
  ```
  1 2
  3 4
  5 6
  7 8
  ```

  i2.txt:
  ```
  1 2 3 4
  5 6 7 8
  ```

  Porgam:
  ```
  Size of 1 Matrix: 2 * 4
  Size of 2 matrix: 4 * 2
  ```

  First matrix:
  ```
  1 2
  3 4
  5 6
  7 8
  ```

  Second matrix:
  ```
  1 2 3 4
  5 6 7 8
  ```

  Select operation on Matrix:
  \1\) Matrix addition
  \2\) Matrix negation
  \3\) Transpose the first matrix
  \4\) Transpose the second matrix
  \5\) Matrix multiplication
  \6\) Matrix determination
  \0\) Exit

  MULTIPLICATION of Matrices:
  ```
  11 14 17 20
  23 30 37 44
  35 46 57 68
  47 62 77 92
  ```
